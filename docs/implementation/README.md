# Implementation Status

This directory records the current implementation state of Arcweft Engine.

Design specifications remain in the numbered `docs/` chapters. Files here describe what exists in the Rust workspace today, what has been verified, and what is intentionally deferred.

## Current Milestone

Phase 0 / Phase 1 minimal Rust workspace:

- Cargo workspace skeleton.
- Foundational ID, source anchor, Need, and dialogue surface model crates.
- Stub language syntax and CLI crates.
- No renderer, Servo, audio, camera, USB, MCP, or Cranelift JIT implementation.

## Files

- `phase-0-1-workspace.md`: current crate layout, public types, verification status, and deferred work.

## Design Reviews Reflected

The implementation notes track accepted syntax decisions from `docs/reviews/` when
they affect parser, HIR, formatter, LSP, or CLI work.

- `pro_review4.md`: adopted value-producing `{ ... }` blocks, `scope name { ... }`
  blocks for relative ID namespaces, unnamed `scope { ... }` as name-omitted
  sugar, relative IDs only in ID-bearing contexts,
  `self::` / `super::` / `crate::` module-path roots, reserved `parent::`
  normalization, and explicit sugar expansion for `with:`, speaker colon lines,
  speaker-preset calls, and `await?`.
- `pro_review5.md`: adopted structured function signatures with generic params,
  curried parameter groups and `where` clauses; structured hook headers
  (`when`, `priority`, `once`, `effects`); structured dialogue line options; and
  a parsed `dialogue defaults` top-level declaration.
- `pro_review7.md`: adopted rowan-compatible lossless CST as the public parsing
  foundation for `arcweft-lang-syntax`, with `ParsedSource` returning syntax,
  typed syntax views, diagnostics, source text metadata, and line index even for
  malformed files. The typed syntax view is still produced by the existing
  parser builder and should be migrated onto CST/event parsing next.
- `pro_review8.md`: accepted VM / Typed IR as the semantic source of truth.
  Native Cranelift JIT is a pure-function optimization tier in
  `arcweft-lang-jit-cranelift`; Wasmtime is only a native plugin/activity
  sandbox; web uses an AOT compiled Wasm player plus bytecode bundle. Data
  formats, manifests, bundles, schemas, bytecode, and save snapshots must remain
  Sans I/O.
- `pro_review9.md`: adopted `@...` entity references, Rust-like `#[...]`
  attributes, ordinary effectful calls instead of `@` scenario commands,
  color-as-string typing, explicit primitive numeric widths, typed unit-number
  literals such as `100pt`, `2.0f32`, `10i32`, and angle units including `rad`.
  Relative IDs are unified on `@.suffix`, parent-dot forms such as
  `@..suffix` / `@...suffix`, and explicit `@super...` forms; bare `.suffix`
  is not part of the core grammar.

## Current Direction

- Parser work now starts from a lossless rowan CST: `SyntaxKind`,
  `ArcweftLanguage`, `SyntaxNode`, source text retention, line index, source
  hash, and always-returning `ParsedSource`.
- The typed parser now receives `CstLineEvents` projected from CST `Line`
  nodes through `From<&SyntaxNode>` instead of splitting raw source
  independently. Each projected line carries a `CstLineKind` classification for
  blank/comment/doc/code handling, and top-level dispatch now starts from
  `CstTopLevelLineKind` / `CstTopLevelItemKind` event classifications owned by
  the CST layer instead of an open-ended parser string chain. This keeps
  declaration detection distinct from AST construction while the grammar moves
  toward rowan events. Flow-body dispatch now likewise starts from CST-owned
  `CstFlowItemKind`, `CstStructuredFlowBlockKind`, and `CstLetFlowItemKind`
  classifications so the typed parser receives a syntax-family event before it
  calls the existing AST builders. Shared balanced
  scans for delimiters, top-level punctuation, top-level keywords, top-level
  whitespace, leading identifiers, lifetimes, entity refs, relative IDs, and
  matching punctuation live in the CST layer so expression, type, pattern, and
  top-level parsing do not grow separate ad hoc splitters. Current line-event
  parsing uses those CST helpers for multiline delimiter recovery, `let`/type
  binding splits, associated-type generic heads, pattern guard splits,
  multi-token separators such as `=>` / `->` / `<-` / `::`, `borrow ... as ...`,
  await grouping, await `with` heads, extern module headers, emit fields,
  scenario command args, labels, entity refs, and shared pattern/type delimiter
  parsing.
- Balanced brace-block collection for ordinary blocks and function-body blocks
  now lives on `CstLineEvents` and returns a `CstBlockEvent`. The typed parser
  still consumes the result, but brace recovery and body-open detection are no
  longer duplicated in parser methods.
- Flow-like block collection also lives on `CstLineEvents`. It keeps contract
  and `effects { ... }` prelude lines in the header while collecting the
  following brace body as the block event, so flow/callable/entity/source
  builders no longer own header-prelude scanning.
- Parser-facing grammar delimiter decisions have been moved out of the typed
  parser's local string scans and into CST helpers. The remaining raw
  character scans live in the CST lexer / CST text utilities themselves, where
  they tokenize source text or implement named text utilities such as wiki-link
  and string-literal extraction. Future grammar behavior should continue to
  enter through CST helpers or grammar-level rowan events rather than parser
  module scans.
- CST reference helpers now keep absolute `EntityRef`, ID-context `IdRef`, and
  family-relative `EntityRefSyntax` separate. `@.suffix`, `@..suffix`,
  `@...suffix`, and `@super...` are accepted only in ID-bearing contexts;
  general relative references use family-qualified forms such as `@flow:.next`
  and `@textbox:.side`. HIR lowering normalizes these structured nodes against
  the current flow, speaker, choice, and named-scope stack.
- Old `@` command and attribute spellings are no longer treated as migration
  syntax. Attributes are `#[...]`; scenario operations use ordinary command /
  call spelling such as `bg @asset.bg.room ...` in the current parser layer.
- Continue migrating typed AST/HIR/checking APIs into semantic views or lowering
  outputs over the CST instead of extending the current line parser.
- Keep `.awfb`, schemas, manifests, bytecode, and save/debug snapshots as pure
  data models and codecs over bytes/strings. Filesystem, network, path watching,
  embedding, signing, upload, and platform storage live in CLI/build/player
  adapters.
- Use `thiserror` for Rust error types across the workspace while preserving
  structured fields such as `kind`, `range`, `anchor`, and `message`.
- Keep `arcweft-core` free of Cranelift, Wasmtime, filesystem, network, GPU,
  audio, device, and OS dependencies.
