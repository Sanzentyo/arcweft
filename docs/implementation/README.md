# Implementation Status

This directory records the current implementation state of Arcweft Engine.

Design specifications remain in the numbered `docs/` chapters. Files here describe what exists in the Rust workspace today, what has been verified, and what is intentionally deferred.

## Current Milestone

Phase 0 / Phase 1 minimal Rust workspace:

- Cargo workspace skeleton.
- Foundational ID, source anchor, Need, and dialogue surface model crates.
- Stub language syntax and CLI crates.
- No renderer, Servo, audio, camera, USB, MCP, or Cranelift JIT implementation.

## Files

- `phase-0-1-workspace.md`: current crate layout, public types, verification status, and deferred work.

## Design Reviews Reflected

The implementation notes track accepted syntax decisions from `docs/reviews/` when
they affect parser, HIR, formatter, LSP, or CLI work.

- `pro_review4.md`: adopted value-producing `{ ... }` blocks, `scope name { ... }`
  blocks for relative ID namespaces, unnamed `scope { ... }` as name-omitted
  sugar, `.suffix` IDs only in ID-bearing contexts,
  `self::` / `super::` / `crate::` module-path roots, reserved `parent::`
  normalization, and explicit sugar expansion for `with:`, speaker colon lines,
  speaker-preset calls, and `await?`.
- `pro_review5.md`: adopted structured function signatures with generic params,
  curried parameter groups and `where` clauses; structured hook headers
  (`when`, `priority`, `once`, `effects`); structured dialogue line options; and
  a parsed `dialogue defaults` top-level declaration.
- `pro_review7.md`: accepted rowan-compatible lossless CST as the direction for
  `arcweft-lang-syntax`, with `ParsedSource` returning syntax, typed AST/HIR
  views, diagnostics, source text metadata, and line index even for malformed
  files. The current line parser remains a temporary MVP and should not grow into
  the final parser architecture.
- `pro_review8.md`: accepted VM / Typed IR as the semantic source of truth.
  Native Cranelift JIT is a pure-function optimization tier in
  `arcweft-lang-jit-cranelift`; Wasmtime is only a native plugin/activity
  sandbox; web uses an AOT compiled Wasm player plus bytecode bundle. Data
  formats, manifests, bundles, schemas, bytecode, and save snapshots must remain
  Sans I/O.

## Current Direction

- Move parser work toward a lossless CST first: `SyntaxKind`, `TokenKind`,
  green tree builder, `SyntaxNode`, source text retention, line index, and
  always-returning `ParsedSource`.
- Keep typed AST/HIR/checking APIs as semantic views or lowering outputs over
  the CST instead of extending the current line parser with more ad hoc splits.
- Keep `.awfb`, schemas, manifests, bytecode, and save/debug snapshots as pure
  data models and codecs over bytes/strings. Filesystem, network, path watching,
  embedding, signing, upload, and platform storage live in CLI/build/player
  adapters.
- Use `thiserror` for Rust error types across the workspace while preserving
  structured fields such as `kind`, `range`, `anchor`, and `message`.
- Keep `arcweft-core` free of Cranelift, Wasmtime, filesystem, network, GPU,
  audio, device, and OS dependencies.

- `docs/00-overview/decisions.md`: canonicalization and high-level language decisions.
- `docs/00-overview/naming.md`: relative ID naming rules.
- `docs/01-language/block-scopes.md`: value-producing blocks and named/unnamed `scope` blocks.
- `docs/01-language/ids-and-references.md`: `.suffix` relative IDs and module-path roots.
- `docs/01-language/grammar.md`: grammar summary for `scope`, relative IDs, module paths, and await grouping.
- `docs/01-language/scenario-surface-syntax.md`: dialogue, choice, and scenario-facing sugar examples.
- `docs/01-language/modules.md`: `self::`, `super::`, `crate::`, and `parent::` normalization.
- `docs/04-tooling/cli.md`: explicit sugar expansion and ID materialization commands.
- `docs/04-tooling/lsp.md`: sugar expansion and ID materialization code actions.
- `docs/02-runtime/core.md`: VM, effect requests, and data-format Sans I/O boundary.
- `docs/02-runtime/cranelift-jit.md`: native-only pure-function JIT boundary.
- `docs/02-runtime/plugins.md`: WIT/Wasm plugin sandbox boundary.
- `docs/05-build-and-security/native-web-build.md`: native/web runtime target model.
- `docs/05-build-and-security/packaging.md`: Sans I/O bundle format boundary.
- `docs/schemas/README.md`: schemas as data formats rather than I/O APIs.
