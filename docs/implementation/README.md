# Implementation Status

This directory records the current implementation state of Arcweft Engine.

Design specifications remain in the numbered `docs/` chapters. Files here describe what exists in the Rust workspace today, what has been verified, and what is intentionally deferred.

## Current Milestone

Phase 0 / Phase 1 minimal Rust workspace:

- Cargo workspace skeleton.
- Foundational ID, source anchor, Need, and dialogue surface model crates.
- Stub language syntax and CLI crates.
- No renderer, Servo, audio, camera, USB, MCP, or Cranelift JIT implementation.

## Files

- `phase-0-1-workspace.md`: current crate layout, public types, verification status, and deferred work.

## Design Reviews Reflected

The implementation notes track accepted syntax decisions from `docs/reviews/` when
they affect parser, HIR, formatter, LSP, or CLI work.

- `pro_review4.md`: adopted value-producing `{ ... }` blocks, named `scope`
  blocks for relative ID namespaces, `.suffix` IDs only in ID-bearing contexts,
  `self::` / `super::` / `crate::` module-path roots, reserved `parent::`
  normalization, and explicit sugar expansion for `with:`, speaker colon lines,
  and `await?`.

The stable specification locations for the `pro_review4.md` decisions are:

- `docs/00-overview/decisions.md`: canonicalization and high-level language decisions.
- `docs/00-overview/naming.md`: relative ID naming rules.
- `docs/01-language/block-scopes.md`: value-producing blocks and named `scope` blocks.
- `docs/01-language/ids-and-references.md`: `.suffix` relative IDs and module-path roots.
- `docs/01-language/grammar.md`: grammar summary for `scope`, relative IDs, module paths, and await grouping.
- `docs/01-language/scenario-surface-syntax.md`: dialogue, choice, and scenario-facing sugar examples.
- `docs/01-language/modules.md`: `self::`, `super::`, `crate::`, and `parent::` normalization.
- `docs/04-tooling/cli.md`: explicit sugar expansion and ID materialization commands.
